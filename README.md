This repository contains a set of three challenges, each one being a unique password-checking program. Your objective is to both deduce the correct password for each level and also understand how to patch the program to bypass the password verification.

## Here's a brief overview of each level:

#### Level 1 : [writeup](level1/writeup.md)
- A direct password checker.
- Password is hardcoded.


#### Level 2 : [writeup](level2/writeup.md)
- A more intricate password transformation process.
- Password undergoes a transformation before verification.


#### Level 3 : [writeup](level3/writeup.md)
- Introduces a prefix and decoding mechanism for the password.
- Password has a specific pattern and encoding.

For detailed information on each level, including how each program works, how to determine the correct password, and how to patch it, follow the respective links.
